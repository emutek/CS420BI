Possibly the easiest way to understand the stupid classes I made is to run
LexParTester.py

LexParTester.py takes at least two arguments
The first should be either 'lex' or 'par' to denote which you want to test
The second is the name of the input file
If you supply a third argument whilst testing Par, the third argument will
be used as the name of the output file for the string of the final
parsed item (goal)

So maybe mucking around with the __str__ methods in ParsedItems.py will help
since my methods produce ugly as anything strings
